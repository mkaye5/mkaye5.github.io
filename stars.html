			<h1>Stars</h1>
			<div>
			Stars are made from clouds of gas that collapse inward when they get too big. The cloud gets so small and hot that it forms a core. The excess dust can form a planet.
			<br>When stars get too big, they can collapse in on themselves and form various stellar objects depending on their size. Small stars become white dwarfs which in turn may become novae. Large stars become supernovae which evolve into black holes or neutron stars.
