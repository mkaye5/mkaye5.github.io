			<h1>Mysteries of Space</h1>
			<div> Dark energy takes up 73% of the Universe. We have realized that the universe was growing, and speeding up as it grew. We are still wondering what is causing these changes. 
<br><br>Scientists have not yet watched dark matter face to face. It does not communicate with baryonic matter and it's utterly invisible to light and other kinds of electromagnetic radiation, which tells us that dark matter impossible to detect with contemporary instruments. But scientists are sure it exists because of the gravitational results it seems to have on galaxies and galaxy clusters. 
<br><br>The physics today, say that the objects closer to the middle of a spinning, spiral galaxy should move much faster than the ones more on the edge. Instead they all move at a similar pace. This baffling observation will only make sense if we suppose that the stars are being pulled by an unseen mass. What we named dark matter. Continue here: Dark matter could also explain certain optical illusions that astronomers see in the deep universe. For example, pictures of galaxies that include strange rings and arcs of light could be explained if the light from even more distant galaxies is being distorted and magnified by massive, invisible clouds of dark matter in the foreground-a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing.
<br><br>Scientists have a few ideas for what dark matter might be. One leading hypothesis is that dark matter consists of exotic particles that don't interact with normal matter or light but that still exert a gravitational pull. Several scientific groups, including one at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, are currently working to generate dark matter particles for study in the lab.
<br><br>Other scientists think the effects of dark matter could be explained by fundamentally modifying our theories of gravity. According to such ideas, there are multiple forms of gravity, and the large-scale gravity governing galaxies differs from the gravity to which we are accustomed.
