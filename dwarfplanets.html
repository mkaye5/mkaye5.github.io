					<td>Pluto</td>
					<td>Pluto was once thought of as a dwarf planet. However, scientists are now still debating whether it is a planet or a dwarf planet. Pluto has mountains, craters, valleys, plains, and maybe glaciers. It was discovered in 1930 and was for a long time it was thought of as the 9th planet in our solar system. When astronomers found more, smaler planets, Pluto was classified again but as a dwarf planet. Some people disagree with that.  Pluto has a radius of 715 miles (1,151 kilometers), Pluto is around 1/6 the width of Earth. It takes sunlight 5.5 hours to travel from the sun to Pluto. Its orbit is 248 years long.Pluto's orbit around the sun is different from the other planets: it is egg-shaped and leaned. A day on Pluto takes about 153 hours on Earth, and it spins almost on its side. Pluto also performs a opposite rotation; spinning from east to west like Venus and Uranus.</td>
					<td>Pluto has a radius of 715 miles (1,151 kilometers), around 1/6 the width of Earth. Pluto's 248-year-long, egg-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units from the sun, and as close as 30 Astronomical Units. One Astronomical Unit is the length between Earth and the sun: about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.) But on average, Pluto is 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the sun.</td>
					<td>The surface of Pluto is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there. At such cold temperatures, water, which is vital for life as we know it, is essentially rock-like. Pluto's interior is warmer, however, and some think there could even be an ocean deep inside.</td>
					<td>Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. Charon, the biggest of Pluto's moons, is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. Our moon is 20 times farther away from Earth than Charon is to Pluto. Pluto and Charon are often referred to as a double planet. Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 153 hours — the same time it takes Pluto to complete one rotation. This means Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of Charon always faces Pluto. Pluto's other four moons are much smaller than Charon. They're also irregularly shaped, not spherical like Charon. Unlike many other moons in the solar system, these moons are not tidally locked to Pluto. They all spin and don’t keep the same face towards Pluto. </td>
					<td>There are no known rings around Pluto.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Makemake</td>
					<td>It is little smaller than Pluto, and is the second-brightest object in the Kuiper Belt seen from Earth. Pluto is the brightest. It takes about 305 years on Earth for it to make one trip around the sun. Makemake is one of the two dwarf planets that when found, made International Astronomical Union to change what a planet would be, and to make a new type of planet: dwarf planet. Eris was the other one that did this. Makemake was named after the Rapanui god of fertility.</td>
					<td>Makemake has a radius of approximately 444 miles (715 kilometers), it is 1/9 the radius of Earth. From about the distance of 4,253,000,000 miles (6,847,000,000 kilometers), this reddish brown planet is 45.8 astronomical units away from the sun.</td>
					<td>The surface of Makemake is terribly cold, so it seems like it isn’t likely that there is life there.</td>
					<td>Makemake has one moon, S/2015 (136472) 1 and it is nicknamed MK 2. It is more than 1,300 times fainter than Makemake. MK 2 was seen around 13,000 miles from the dwarf planet, and its radius is approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers).</td>
					<td>There are no rings around Makemake that we know of.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Ceres</td>
					<td>Dwarf planet Ceres is the biggest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system. It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801. And when Dawn arrived in 2015, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to receive a visit from a spacecraft.</td>
					<td>With a radius of 296 miles (476 kilometers), Ceres is 1/13 the radius of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Ceres would be about as big as a poppy seed. From an average distance of 257 million miles (413 million kilometers), Ceres is 2.8 astronomical units away from the sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 22 minutes to travel from the sun to Ceres.</td>
					<td>Ceres is one of the few places in our solar system where scientists would like to search for possible signs of life. Ceres has something a lot of other planets don't: water. Here on Earth, water is essential for life, so it's possible that with this ingredient and a few other conditions met, life could maybe exist there. Living things on Ceres, if they are there at all, would likely be very small microbes similar to bacteria. And while Ceres might not have living things today, there could be signs it harbored life in the past.</td>
					<td>Ceres does not have any moons.</td>
					<td>Ceres does not have any rings.</td>

				<tr>
					<td>Haumea</td>
					<td>Originally designated 2003 EL61 (and nicknamed Santa by one discovery team), Haumea resides in the Kuiper belt and is roughly the same size as Pluto. Haumea is one of the fastest rotating large objects in our solar system. Its fast spin distorts Haumea's shape, making this dwarf planet look like a football.</td>
					<td>With a radius of about 385 miles (620 kilometers), Haumea is about 1/14 the radius of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Haumea would be about as big as a sesame seed. From an average distance of 4,010,000,000 miles (6,452,000,000 kilometers), Haumea is 43 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 6 hours to travel from the Sun to Haumea.</td>
					<td>The surface of Haumea is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there.</td>
					<td>Haumea has two known moons: Namaka is the inner moon, and Hi'iaka is the outer moon. Both are named for the mythological daughters of Huamea. Hi'aka is the patron goddess of the island of Hawaii and of hula dancers. Namaka is a water spirit in Hawaiian mythology.</td>
					<td>Haumea has no known rings.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Eris</td>
					<td>Eris first appeared to be larger than Pluto. This triggered a debate in the scientific community that led to the International Astronomical Union's decision in 2006 to clarify the definition of a planet. Pluto, Eris and other similar objects are now classified as dwarf planets. Originally designated 2003 UB313 (and nicknamed for the television warrior Xena by its discovery team), Eris is named for the ancient Greek goddess of discord and strife. The name fits since Eris remains at the center of a scientific debate about the definition of a planet.</td>
					<td>With a radius of about 722 miles (1,163 kilometers), Eris is about 1/5 the radius of Earth. Eris, like Pluto, is a little smaller than Earth's Moon. If the Earth were the size of a nickel, Eris would be about as big as a popcorn kernel.From an average distance of 6,289,000,000 miles (10,125,000,000 kilometers), Eris is 37.9 astronomical units away from the sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 5 hours and 15 minutes to travel from the sun to Eris.</td>
					<td>The surface of Eris is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there.</td>
					<td>Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia. Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days. This moon is named after Eris' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness. Dysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other.</td>
					<td>Eris has no known rings.</td>
