			<h1>Planets</h1>
			<div>Mercury: Mercury is the planet closest to the sun. Because of that you cannot really see it until dusk. While orbiting the sun twice, it makes 3 turns around its axis. Mercury also is the smallest planet in the solar system. It is only a little larger than Earth’s moon. 59 Earth days make one day on Mercury. 175.97 Earth days makes one day and night on Mercury. One year on Mercury takes 88 days on Earth. Mercury is a rocky, solid and cratered planet, a lot like our moon. Mercury has a thin atmosphere, or exosphere, and it is made up of mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K). Atoms that are fired off the surface by the solar wind and micrometeoroid forces make Mercury's exosphere. Mercury does not have moons. Mercury does not have rings like Saturn. No evidence of life has been found on Mercury. Daytime temperatures can reach 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit) and drop to -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) at night. It is highly improbable that life that we know could survive on this planet. But Mercury is not the hottest planet, though it is the fastest. 
			<br><br> Venus: Venus is farther away from the sun. It is the second planet in the solar system, and Earth’s closest neighbor. The dense atmosphere of Venus captures heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. Its surface temperatures are hot enough to melt lead. Brief sightings below the clouds show volcanoes and misshapen mountains. Venus is about Earth’s size, just a little smaller. Sunlight takes six minutes to go from the sun to Venus. The rotation and orbit of Venus are different in many ways. Only two planets orbit from east to west: one of them is Venus. One day on Venus is 243 days on Earth. That is longer than a whole year on Venus. One day and night takes 117 Earth days. A year on Venus is 225 days on Earth. It is also the only planet that orbits the sun in a almost perfect circle. The axis is tilted only 3 degrees, so Venus spins nearly upright, and so it does not experience perceptible seasons. Venus is a terrestrial planet so it has a middle core, a rocky outside, and a solid crust. 
			<br><br>  Earth: Earth is our home planet, the one we live on. It orbits the sun every year, rotating around 365.251 days. It has around three distinct layers: a solid core, a viscous mantle, and a crust. The crust is made mostly of granite and basalt, with continental land consisting of the former and oceanic crust consisting of the latter.
			<br><br>  Mars: Mars is the most explored planet in our solar system other that earth. It is the 4th planet from the sun and Earth’s neighbor. Mars is a cold, and dusty desert world with a very thin atmosphere. It has seasons, extinct volcanoes, polar ice caps, canyons and weather. It is the only planet NASA has sent rovers to. Some of the explorations have found clues that mars could have had a humid, and hotter temperature and a thick atmosphere billions of years ago. Mars has a reddish color,which is similar to blood which is why it was named Mars after the Greek God. Today Mars is regularly called the ‘Red Planet.’ Mars gets its color because the iron mineral dirt rust making the red color seen. Mars is around half of Earth’s size. It has a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers). It takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel to Mars. As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one turn every 24.6 hours, which is very close to a day on Earth which is 23.9 hours. Mars's days are called sols that are short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 687 days on Earth. Its axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees. This is another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct seasons, but they are longer than seasons on Earth because Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun since it is farther away. And while on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars' elliptical orbit around the Sun. Spring in the northern hemisphere or autumn in the southern, is the longest season with 194 sols. Autumn in the northern hemisphere or spring in the southern, is the shortest with 142 days. Northern winter or southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer or southern winter is 178 sols. Mars named after the Roman god of war because of its blood red coloring.
			<br><br>  Jupiter: Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is by far, the biggest planet in the solar system! It is more than twice as big as all the other planets put together! Jupiter's stripes and swirls are really cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in its atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has gone on for hundreds of years! Jupiter has by more than 65 known moons. Scientists are most interested in the Galilean satellites which are the four largest moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Jupiter also has many rings, but unlike the famous rings of Saturn, Jupiter’s rings are very faint and made of dust, not ice. Jupiter is named after the king of the ancient Roman gods.​ Jupiter has a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), it is 11 times wider than Earth. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit, is the distance from the Sun to Earth. Sunlight takes 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter. Jupiter has the shortest day in our solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year for Jupiter) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days). Its axis is tilted just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins nearly upright,  and does not have seasons as similar as other planets do. Jupiter was made when the rest of the solar system was created about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in together to become this huge gas planet. Jupiter took most of the mass left over after the formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice the material of the other bodies in the solar system put together. In fact, Jupiter has the same ingredients as a star, but it did not grow massive enough to become one. 
			<br><br>  Saturn: Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Around it is a beautiful system of icy rings, which makes Saturn  unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a enormous ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has more than 60 moons known to us, Saturn is home to some of the most captivating landscapes in our solar system. From the spurts of water that spray from Enceladus to the lakes of methane on Titan  who is full of smog, Saturn is a good source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries. The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the naked human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter. With a radius of 36,183.7 miles (58,232 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth. It takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn. Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day on Saturn takes only 10.7 hours, and Saturn makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in the Saturn time) in about 29.4 Earth years (10,756 Earth days). Its axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees which is close to Earth's 23.5-degree lean. This means that Saturn has seasons. Saturn is largely made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main parts that make up the Sun.
			<br><br>  Uranus: Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun with the third biggest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is windy and cold. This ice planet has 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it turns at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This tilt that only Uranus makes causes Uranus seem to spin on its side. This is the first planet found by a telescope and it was discovered by a astronomer William Herschel in 1781. First he thought though that it was a star or a comet. It was two years later that it was accepted world wide as a new planet, partly because Johann Elert Bode had written down some observations about it. The planet was named for Uranus, after the Greek god of the sky, which was suggested by Johann Bode. It has a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers), Uranus is around 4 times wider than Earth. From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers).The sun is 19.8 astronomical units away from Uranus. So it takes sunlight 2 hours 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus. A day on Uranus takes about 17 hours. A year on Uranus is about 84 Earth years (30,687 Earth days). Uranus is the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle to its orbit, with a tilt of 97.77 degrees. People think possibly the result of a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago. This unique tilt causes the most extreme seasons in the solar system. For nearly a quarter of each Uranian year, the Sun shines directly over each pole, plunging the other half of the planet into a 21-year-long, dark winter. Uranus is also one of just two planets that rotate in the opposite direction than most of the planets, from east to west. Uranus took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this iceplanet. Like its neighbor Neptune, Uranus likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago, where it is the seventh planet from the Sun.
			<br><br>  Neptune: Neptune is the eighth planet in our solar system and the farthest one from earth. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. Neptune takes 165 years to orbit and is so far from the Sun that 12 in the afternoon on Neptune would be dim twilight. The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune. The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical calculations, as it is too far to see with the naked eye. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea and is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball. From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units away from the Sun. From this distance, it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune. One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate or spin once). And Neptune makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Neptunian time) in about 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth days). Sometimes Neptune is even farther from the Sun than dwarf planet Pluto. Pluto's highly eccentric, oval-shaped orbit brings it inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period every 248 Earth years. This switch, in which Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune, happened most recently from 1979 to 1999. Pluto can never crash into Neptune, though, because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun, Pluto makes two. This repeating pattern prevents close approaches of the two bodies. Neptune’s axis of rotation is tilted 28 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to the axial tilts of Mars and Earth. This means that Neptune experiences seasons just like we do on Earth; however, since its year is so long, each of the four seasons lasts for over 40 years. Neptune took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago.
